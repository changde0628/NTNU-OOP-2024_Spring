### Course Description

This course aims to cultivate engineers with strong object-oriented programming skills. It aligns with the core competencies of the department as follows:

1. Learn how to write programs using physical, mathematical, and electrical engineering knowledge and techniques.
2. Master the segmentation of main and subprograms, loops, and object writing.
3. Understand how to integrate algorithms into programs and evaluate time complexity.
4. Incorporate data structures into programs effectively.
5. Develop the ability to write systems and integrate them into electrical engineering projects.
6. Equip students with object-oriented programming capabilities.

## Syllabus

### Instructor: Prof. Kang Li-Wei

### Course Outline and Topics

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming methodology based on the concept of "objects." It is an essential skill for software development. Given that students have prior experience with C language programming in their first year and have implemented data structures using the C programming language in their second year, this course will introduce the classic object-oriented programming language: C++. It shares many similarities with the C programming language, making it suitable as the first object-oriented programming language for students. The course syllabus is outlined below:

1. Week 1: Course Introduction
2. Week 2: C++ Basics
3. Week 3: Flow Control and Function Calls in C++
4. Week 4: I/O Streams and File Handling in C++
5. Week 5: Arrays in C++
6. Week 6: Strings and Vectors in C++
7. Week 7: Pointers and Dynamic Arrays in C++
8. Week 8: Midterm Exam
9. Week 9: Defining Classes in C++
10. Week 10: Friends, Overloaded Operators, and Arrays in Classes (Part I)
11. Week 11: Friends, Overloaded Operators, and Arrays in Classes (Part II)
12. Week 12: Separate Compilation and Namespaces
13. Week 13: Inheritance
14. Week 14: Templates
15. Week 15: Standard Template Library (STL)
16. Week 16: Final Exam
